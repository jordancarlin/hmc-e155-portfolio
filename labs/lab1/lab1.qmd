## Introduction
In Lab 1, the overall goal was to ensure our E155 Development Boards were working correctly and to learn about the process of programming the FPGA and MCU. Both boards (FPGA and MCU) were initially programmed with example code to ensure the software flow was working. Afterwards, the FPGA was programmed with a custom design to control a 7-segment display and several LEDs based on a series of DIP switches.

## FPGA Design
### Task
Per the [provided specifications](https://hmc-e155.github.io/lab/lab1/#fpga-design) for the lab, 4 DIP switches should be used as inputs to control the following outputs:

| OUTPUT | INPUT | OPERATION |
|:----:|:----:|:--------:|
| LED 0 | S[0:1] | XOR |
| LED 1 | S[2:3] | AND |
| LED 2 | 48 MHz clock | 2.4 Hz blink |
| 7-Segment Display | S[0:3] | binary decoder |

### Approach
To aid in debugging and reusability, I broke this into several SystemVerilog modules, each contained within its own file. I used the following modules:

| SystemVerilog Module | Description |
|:----:|:----:|
| lab1_jc | FPGA specific module, includes clock module |
| top | top-level, non FPGA-specific module |
| seg_decoder | 7-segment display decoder |
| pulse | Output pulse of desired frequency based on clk |

The following block diagram shows how these modules fit together and the inputs/outputs of each.

### Testing
I ran into lots of issues with QuestaSim on my personal computer (tried both Linux and Windows)
